1. reload table A, B, AllTuplePairs
2. Retrain on a sampe to get random foreest model
3. Apply RF to AllTuplePairs and save matched tuples to one file and unmatched to another?
4. Write schema mapper to get new table from matched pairs. Think of which value to use for each field.
5. Add unmatched tuples from A and B to theis table, same schema
6. Analysis

A- IMDB, B= numbers M= matched table
